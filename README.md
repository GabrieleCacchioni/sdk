`The global, decentralized, open-sourced and permissonless protocol. Built on Solana.`

# Monaco Protocol SDK

Welcome to the Software Development Kit for the Monaco Protocol. 

Everything you should need to get up and running to develop against the protocol can be found in this repository. This is also the home of the developer community where you can find information about the latest updates, showcase what you've been building, and ask any questions if you're looking for some help. Head on over to [discussions](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/discussions) to orientate yourself.

# The Monaco Protocol

The Monaco Protocol is a decentralized liquidity network for exchange-based applications built on the Solana blockchain. It serves as crucial infrastructure upon which third-party front-end applications for wagering on binary outcome events can be built while accessing a shared liquidity pool.

## Why is the Monaco Protocol useful? 

Creating a shared liquidity pool across wagering applications will streamline the wagering process, provide greater liquidity for participants, reduce spreads and lower prices, lower the take rates of institutions and middlemen, reduce settlement times, increase transparency, and improve capital efficiency.

## Why Solana?

For any exchange-based mechanism, high throughput and low costs are the key pillars of foundation for building amazing user experiences - the Solana blockchain offers theoretical TPS speeds of up to 50,000/second with costs of a fraction of a cent. By building on the Solana blockchain, the Monaco Protocol delivers high speeds and low transaction costs while eliminating counter-party risk. 

## Is the Protocol audited?

We are currently in the process of an audit, we will release additional information on this once the the audit is complete. 

## How do I contribute to the Protocol? 

More information about this will be available soon.

## Have any applications built on the Monaco Protocol?

There has, head on over to https://betdex.gitbook.io/betdex-beta/ to learn more about the BetDEX Exchange.

## What is the relationship between BetDEX Labs, Inc. and the Monaco Protocol?

BetDEX Labs, Inc. is an early and key contributor to the Monaco Protocol.
