# Monaco Protocol SDK

Welcome to the Software Development Kit for the Monaco Protocol.

Everything you need to develop against the protocol can be found in this repository. This is also the home of the developer community where you can find information about the latest updates, showcase what you've been building, and, most importantly, ask any questions if you're looking for some help.

Head on over to [discussions](https://github.com/@monaco-protocol/client/sdk/discussions) to orientate yourself.
