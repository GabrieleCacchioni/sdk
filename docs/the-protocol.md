# The Protocol

## The Monaco Protocol

The Monaco Protocol is a decentralized liquidity network for exchange-based applications built on the Solana blockchain. It serves as crucial infrastructure upon which third-party front-end applications for wagering on binary outcome events can be built while accessing a shared liquidity pool.

### Why is the Monaco Protocol useful?

Creating a shared liquidity pool across wagering applications will streamline the wagering process, provide greater liquidity for participants, reduce spreads and lower prices, lower the take rates of institutions and middlemen, reduce settlement times, increase transparency, and improve capital efficiency.

### Why Solana?

For any exchange-based mechanism, high throughput and low costs are the key pillars of foundation for building amazing user experiences - the Solana blockchain offers theoretical TPS speeds of up to 50,000/second with costs of a fraction of a cent. By building on the Solana blockchain, the Monaco Protocol delivers high speeds and low transaction costs while eliminating counter-party risk.

### Is the Protocol audited?

The protocol is currently in the process of an audit, additional information on this will be released once the the audit is complete.
